    #What this Instance Method does is that it finds the first shortest path between 2 nodes in the Adjacency 
    #List Directed Graph Data Structure (in terms of number of nodes in between the 2 nodes, instead of the
    #weighted cost of the edges since this is not a weighted Graph Data Structure)

    #It takes in 3 parameters, 
    #'startnode' representing the starting node from which the shortest path will originate from

    #'endnode' parameter representing the end node where which the shortest path will end at
    
    #'path', which is set as an empty List by default, which is used to keep track of the current path being 
    #explored (see the part when this Instance Method is called recursively in the Instance Method) 

    #Similar to the 'get_all_possible_paths' Instance Method, since Graph Data Structures are recursive Data 
    #Structure, it makes sense for us to use recursion in this Instance Method as well


    #Here is a ChatGPT's attempt to explain all the recursiveness step-by-step in the Instance Method:

    # -The Instance Method starts by appending the 'startnode' to the path.

    # -It then checks if the 'startnode' and 'endnode' are the same. If so, it means the path is complete, 
    #  and it returns the current path as the shortest path.

    # -Otherwise, it initializes 'shortest_path' to None. This variable will be used to keep track of the 
    #  shortest path found so far.

    # -It iterates through each neighbor node ('node') of the 'startnode' using 'for node in 
    #  'self.graph_dictionary[startnode]:'

    # -If the neighbor node ('node') is not already in the current path, it means we can explore it further
    #  to find more paths.

    # -It calls itself, the 'get_shortest_path' Instance Method recursively with the neighbor node ('node')
    #  as the new 'startnode', with the same end node as the 'endnode', and the updated path values.

    # -The result of the recursive call is stored in the 'sp' variable. If there is a path found, 'sp' will 
    #  contain the List representing that path. Otherwise, it will be None.

    # -If 'sp' is not None, it means a path exists from the current start node to the end.

    # -It then compares the length of the path 'sp' to the current 'shortest_path'. If 'shortest_path' is 
    #  None, (i.e., no shortest path found yet) or if the length of 'sp' is shorter than the length of 
    #  'shortest_path', it updates 'shortest_path' to 'sp'.
    
    # -After exploring all possible paths from the current start node, the method returns the 
    # 'shortest_path'.


    #(Note: A problem with this Instance Method is that if there is 2 paths that have the same number of
    #nodes between the 2 nodes ('startnode' and 'endnode'), then it will only return the first path out of
    #the 2 paths with the same shortest path (in terms of number of nodes in between the 2 nodes). Such as
    #in this case there are 2 shortest paths, '["Mumbai", "Paris", "New York"]' and 
    #'["Mumbai", "Dubai", "New York"]' but this Instance Method will only return the first path found, 
    #'["Mumbai", "Paris", "New York"]', so this is a flaw as it would be better to return both shortest paths.
